#Setup instructions

- React
- Mui

#Approach 

- For my project I wanted to build a simple london branch website for a charity run buddhist community who my father is a part of.
  He will be the one manging the website so my gaol was to keep the UI simple, easy to update and manage.

- Learning more about Mui and solifiying my knowledge in React was also one of my goals for this project,
  the way you can create customizable responsive components incredibly fast with Mui was a joy to use!
