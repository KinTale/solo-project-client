            The Buddhist Community Centre UK (BCCUK) was founded in 2007 with a vision to establish a monastery to serve the growing Buddhist Community in the Southeast region of the United Kingdom. After several years of hard work, dedication and fund raising activities by our dedicated committee members, a former social club was purchased and transformed into a traditional monastery.

            Our monastery was consecrated and named by His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche as ‘Tashi Dongak Choeling’ on the 18th of July 2014. Following this, our patron His Holiness The 14th Dalai Lama officially inaugurated our monastery on the 29th of June 2015. &nbsp;

            We are a registered charity organisation run by a team of volunteers with an aim to provide a peaceful place for meditation, and a community of support for the practice of Buddhism. Our centre has hosted public talks by His Holiness the Dalai Lama twice up to date, and continues to be blessed through the visits and teachings from many great Rinpoches. Alongside this, the centre also facilitates various ritual ceremonies ranging from weddings, naming ceremonies to funerals.
