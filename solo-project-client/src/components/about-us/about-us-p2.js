                The centre is also used as a place for discussing community welfare issues and facilitates counselling and support where able. Working closely with local healthcare and policing teams, we have organised health awareness days, as well as health check ups for the elderly. As a charity founded on the principle of compassion, the centre was able to raise funds and help co-ordinate the disaster relief effort following the Nepal Earthquake crisis of 2015. Locally, we have supported a variety of charities including those involving homeless children, ‘Catch 22’ and ‘Step by Step’. In the future, we hope to continue expanding our humanitarian work alongside our religious.

The variety of social and cultural activities, and regular mindfulness meditation classes carried out at the centre integrates people of all ages and faiths, making BCCUK a warm hub of community activity in Aldershot. Last year alone, the BCCUK attracted over 17000 local and international visitors, reflecting the growing popularity and demand of the BCCUK.

                For years to come, I hope our centre will serve as a welcome oasis for all, where one can discover Buddha nature, achieve equanimity and find ultimate liberation.
